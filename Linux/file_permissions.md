chmod:<br/>

Another way to use chmod is to provide the permissions you wish to give to the owner, group, and others as a three-digit number. The leftmost digit represents the<br/>permissions for the owner.<br/> The middle digit represents the permissions for the group members. The rightmost digit represents the permissions for the others.
<br/>
The digits you can use and what they represent are listed here:<br/>

0: (000) No permission.<br/>
1: (001) Execute permission.<br/>
2: (010) Write permission.<br/>
3: (011) Write and execute permissions.<br/>
4: (100) Read permission.<br/>
5: (101) Read and execute permissions.<br/>
6: (110) Read and write permissions.<br/>
7: (111) Read, write, and execute permissions.<br/>
