# Lambda

#### Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
- You organize your code into Lambda functions. 
- Lambda runs your function only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. 
- You pay only for the compute time that you consumeâ€”there is no charge when your code is not running.

## Use Cases

- Backing up data in S3 : For eg if you want to replicate data of a bucket everytime it is uploaded you can create a lambda function which will be triggered everytime a data is uploaded in s3. This is applicable when you want to replicate data across different aws accounts. 

- Process images when they are uploaded.
